# Yuuk PCB

## Licensing and disclaimer

These files were made available by Quantrik (the designer of the Kyuu keyboard) himself in [a GitHub page](https://github.com/Quantrik/Kyuu). Refer to the licensing of the original files for clarification as to how to use them.

I (Gondolindrim) hold no power over nor ownership of the original files. I am just using them to design an improved version of the PCB; the AOHL v1.3 license used for the new version (codenamed Yuuk) is compatible with the share-alike version of the files provided by Quantrik.

The only alteration made by me to the files was a porting to a newer KiCad version, hence the different file extensions. I also removed non-essential files like the `gerbers` folder (which will be released later when Yuuk's final version is done), the `rescue-backups` folder (since it is redundant), the `.sch`, `.brd` and `.pro` files as these belong to the older KiCad version.
